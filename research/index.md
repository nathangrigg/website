# Past research

While an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, I worked with Tyler Jarvis as part of BYU's tropical algebra research group. For more information, see the research group's [web page][tropical]. A big part of my work there was my [maple code][maple] and my [honors thesis][thesis] (1MB pdf). If I were to do it over again, I would write the code in [sage][sage].
