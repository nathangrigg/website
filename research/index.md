I am currently a graduate student at the University of Washington. My advisor is [Max Lieblich][max]. I do [algebraic geometry][ag]. I plan to graduate in 2013.

More specifically, I study deformations of abelian categories, especially
deformations of the category of coherent sheaves on a scheme.
Infinitessimal deformations of Coh(X) are parametrized by
the second Hochschild cohomology of X. Using the HKR isomorphism, 
a deformation of the category can be decomposed into 
a deformation of the scheme X, a noncommutative deformation, and a gerby
deformation. One aspect of my research is to describe how this decomposition
generalizes to more general deformation situations.

A Fourier-Mukai equivalence induces an isomorphism of Hochschild cohomology
(hence of the spaces of infinitessimal deformations).
In general, this isomorphism mixes summands of the HKR decomposition. This is
interesting because scheme deformations of one scheme may correspond to
non-commutative or gerby
deformations of a Fourier-Mukai partner. One aspect of my research describes
this phenomenon in the case of two K3 surfaces X and M, where M is a moduli
space of sheaves on X with some fixed Mukai vector (or chern character).

# Past research

While an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, I worked with Tyler Jarvis as part of BYU's tropical algebra research group. For more information, see the research group's [web page][tropical]. A big part of my work there was my [maple code][maple] and my [honors thesis][thesis] (1MB pdf). If I were to do it over again, I would write the code in [sage][sage].
