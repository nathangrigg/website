## The textbook

We are using Boyce and DiPrima's *Elementary Differential Equations and
Boundary Value Problems*, 9th edition. You may also purchase the custom
edition from the University Book Store, which only contains chapters 1-3
and 6. This is all you will need for this course.

## The 8th edition

There are not many differences between the 8th and 9th editions. You are
free to use an 8th edition of the book if you wish, but you are
responsible for making sure that you study the correct material and turn
in the correct homework. You may check out the 9th edition of the book
for 2 hours at a time from Odegaard Reserve.

The main differences between 8th and 9th editions are the section
numbering of Chapter 3 and the homework problems. You can see a
[detailed list of
changes](http://www.math.washington.edu/~arms/m3xx.guide/m307.text.html).
