# Please follow these guidelines when doing your homework assignments.

1.  Please write your name clearly on each page. This is to prevent any
    confusion if any loose pages are misplaced from someone's
    assignment.
2.  Please write the assignment out on the first page.
3.  Please box your final answers for each problem.
4.  Please organized your work. If a problem continues onto another
    page, or if you did a problem in the middle of the section at the
    end of the assignment, please indicate where the problem is located.
    i.e. (\#3 - located on last page) or (\#29 continued on next page)
5.  Please staple your assignment.

**Points may be deducted for unstapled or disorganized homework**
