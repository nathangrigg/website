## About Lessons

This is Lesson 1M, which means it corresponds to the Monday class of Week 1. Usually you will read the lessons _before_ class. The lessons give you a quick introduction to the material so that we can spend class time doing examples and talking about the more advanced material.

Lessons will always be posted a full day in advance. For example, for a Wednesday class, the lesson will be posted by early Tuesday morning.
If you do not see something posted by then, it means there is no lesson for the next class.

## The first day of class

If you missed class, you should read over the [syllabus][syl] and look at the [presentation][key] that we covered in class. Then get started on the [homework][hw].

## The next lesson

Before you come to class on Wednesday, look at [Lesson 1W][1W]. Give yourself 30 minutes, watch the videos, and do the practice problem.
