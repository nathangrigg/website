Linear equations are much more predictable than nonlinear equations. The method of integrating factors requires you to integrate two times, once to find the integrating factor, and once to solve the differential equation. But the process is always the exact same. Here is a video example.

Example 3 from section 2.1 of the textbook is another good example of the method of integrating factors. The page before Example 3 gives a complete description of why the integrating factor is what it is.

Before coming to class, solve the following differential equation: {% math %} y'+3y = t+e^{-2t}. {% endmath %}
