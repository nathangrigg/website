Second order linear homogeneous differential equations, with constant coefficients are pretty easy to solve, and you don't have to do any integration.

Here is a video showing how to solve them.

After watching the video, use the method to solve this initial value problem:
\\[ 2y'' - 3y' -2 y = 0 \quad y(0)=1 \quad y'(0)=2 \\]
