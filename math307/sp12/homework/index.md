# Homework

Problem listed inside brackets will be handed in on the listed due date.
The other problems will not be handed in or graded.

In almost every case, it is a bad idea to skip homework problems. If it helps motivate you, know that the quiz questions will be very similar to homework problems.




## Homework 1, due Friday, April 6

- 1.1: 3, 16, 18
- 1.3: 5, 6, 8, 9
- 2.2: 2, 3, 9, 13, 21, [27]
- 2.1: 1, 10, 14, [16], [30]

## Homework 2, due Friday, April 13

- 2.4: 22, [32]
- 2.5: 3, 5, [7], [20]
- 2.7: 2abc

Note on Problem 2.7.2: On part (b), _t_ is not equal to _h_. This means that you will have use Euler's method twice to approximate the IVP at _t_ = 0.1, twice more to approximate the IVP at _t_ = 0.2, etc. You have a similar issue on part (c).
