All homework and quiz scores are now posted in the [Catalyst grade book][1]. The final exam and class grade will be posted some time in the next few days. If you have any questions about your grade, send me an email.

If you want to pick up your exam or any of the old homework or quizzes, you can come to my office on Monday, June 11, between 10:00 to 12:00. You can also come to my office any time before December. Come during office hours (which will be posted on this site) or send me an email to make sure I'll be around.

Have a good summer.
