In 2.1.30, the solution to the differential equation has an _e_^_t_ term. The
only way for the initial value problem to remain finite as _t_ goes to infinity
is if the initial value causes this term  to disappear.

For 2.2.27, you can use a slope field to answer part (a). You will need to solve
the differential equation for part (b). You will want to use [partial
fractions][coverup] to do the integration when solving the differential
equation.

For 2.3.19, you will probably have a better chance of being correct if you write
a differential equation for _Q_\'(_t_) and not for _c_\'(_t_).
