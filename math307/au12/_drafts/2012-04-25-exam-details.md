You may use up to 5 pages of notes (printed or written on both sides) on the exam. You may use a non graphing calculator.

The problems on the exams will be more difficult than the quiz questions, in the same way that the homework problems from the end of the sections are more difficult than the homework problems from the beginning of the sections.
Some exams from a previous quarter are on the [exams page](exams/).

The midterm exam will be in class on Monday, April 30.
