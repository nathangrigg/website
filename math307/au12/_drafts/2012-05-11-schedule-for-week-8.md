Things will be a little different for Week 8 from what they normally are.

- There will be no class on Friday, May 18.
- The quiz will be on Wednesday, May 16, instead of Friday. It will cover sections 6.1 and 6.2. I do not expect you to memorize any Laplace transform formulas.
- There will be no office hours on Wednesday or Friday.
Please email me any questions you have.
