The makeup quiz will be given on Friday. There will be a single quiz with three problems. You must choose one problem to do.

- The first problem will be from section 2.1 or 2.2. If you do this problem, your score will replace the score you got on Quiz 1.
- The second problem will be from section 2.4 or 2.5. If you do this problem, your score will replace the score you got on Quiz 2.
- The third problem will be from section 3.1 or 3.3. If you do this problem, your score will replace the score you got on Quiz 3.

If you do worse on the make up quiz than you did on the original quiz, I will not change your score.

The quiz will be given the last 15 minutes of class. If you do not want to take the makeup quiz, you can leave at that point.
