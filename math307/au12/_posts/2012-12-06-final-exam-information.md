The final exam will be held on Wednesday, December 12, in our usual classroom but at the unusual time of 8:30 am. The final exam may test anything we have discussed in class, the lessons, or the homework this quarter.

You may use a non-graphing calculator and two pages of notes. Each page of notes can be front and back of a standard-sized sheet of paper; hand-written, photocopied, or typed.

I will not provide Laplace transform formulas, so you will probably want to include these in your notes. If you want, you can just use a [copy of the Laplace Table][1] from the book.
