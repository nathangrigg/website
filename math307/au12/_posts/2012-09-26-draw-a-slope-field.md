Here is the [slope field generator](http://staff.washington.edu/grigg/slopefield/) I mentioned in class yesterday. It may help you as you do your homework. Slope fields are a great way to visual first order differential equations.
I wrote the program recently, so if you run into a bug, send me an email.
