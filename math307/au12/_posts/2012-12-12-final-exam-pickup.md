Final exam grades will be posted as soon as I finish grading them.

I will be in my office on Friday from 1:00 to 2:00 if you would like to pick up your final exam. Or, you may send me an email any time during winter quarter to arrange a time to pick up your final exam. At the end of winter quarter, all remaining exams will be discarded.
