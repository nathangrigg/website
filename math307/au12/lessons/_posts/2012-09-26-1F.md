## First example

Watch this video of me working through a separable equation.

Read Example 2 of Section 2.2 in the textbook, where you will find a similar problem.

Then do one on your own:
\\[ y'=\frac{1-x^2}{y^2} \\]

Check your answer using [Wolfram Alpha][1]

## Notes and warnings

If you aren't careful, you can lose constant solutions when solving separable differential equations. Here's an example, along with some common, easily avoided mistakes.
