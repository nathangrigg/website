description: Although the method from Monday technically works even if the roots to the characteristic equation are not real, there is a way to eliminate the imaginary numbers by using sines and cosines. Section 3.3.

## Complex Exponentiation

Every complex number can be written in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers and \\(i=\sqrt{-1}\\).

If you are solving a linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients, \\(e^{rt}\\) is a solution if \\(r\\) is a root of the characteristic equation. But what if \\(r\\) is complex?

What is \\(e^{(a+bi)t}\\)? It is \\[e^{at}\big(\cos(bt)+ i\sin(bt)\big).\\]


This is called _Euler's formula_.


Practice by computing \\(e^{i\pi}\\) and \\(e^{1+i}\\).


## Solving differential equations when there are complex roots to the characteristic equation.

Now we want to use this to solve a differential equation. The good news is, we can eliminate the imaginary numbers. Here is how it works:
