Here is a video going through all the steps of solving a differential equation that has a function that is defined piecewise.

You can download [the slides][1] I used if you want to make notes as you follow along. Each step is fairly simple, but combining all the steps together takes care and persistance.

This one is longer than usual (20 minutes).
