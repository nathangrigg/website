To analyze oscillations, it is very helpful to be able to combine multiple sine and cosine terms into a single term. You can do this, as long as the sines and cosines you want to combine have the same frequency. Here is how it works:

## Try it out

Write \\(\sin(4t)-\cos(4t)\\) in the form \\(A\cos(4t-\delta)\\).

Then use your work to calculate when \\(e^t\sin(4t) - e^t\cos(4t)\\) crosses the equilibrium position for the third time.

## Animations

Here are links to animations to help you see how the solution changes as you change parts of the differential equation.

If you [increase the damping][damping] while holding everything else constant, the quasi period increases.

If you [increase the initial velocity][velocity] (or initial position) while leaving everything else the same, you get the same basic oscillation shape, but at a higher amplitude.
