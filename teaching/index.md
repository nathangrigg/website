# Teaching experience

I enjoy teaching mathematics and strive to improve my teaching every quarter. I want to find the ways that students learn best, and adjust my teaching to match.

Here are some of the things I have made to help students learn.

## Videos

During Spring 2012, I made a series of short videos to introduce material
before we discussed it in class. The students were assigned a "lesson"
to complete before coming to class. For example,
[this lesson][1] introduces second order linear homogeneous differential equations using a six-minute video. The entire list of lessons can be found
[here][2].

The videos were a big success. The students used them and appreciated them, and class time was very productive as a result. I used the videos again during
Autumn 2012 with similar results.

## Teaching aids

While teaching differential equations, I made a Python program
to draw slope fields and made it accessible via the internet.
On [this page][3], you can enter an equation and see the slope field.

I also made several [animations][4] to help students visualize things
like [parametrizing with respect to arc length][5], [resonance][6],
and [damping][7].
