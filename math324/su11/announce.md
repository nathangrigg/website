  I will be in my office from 9-10 am on Tuesday, August 23, to return exams or answers questions you have about the exam. If you don't pick up your exam on Tuesday, you can send me an email in October, November, or December to pick up your exam. After that, they will be shredded.

- **Final Exam Take Home Problem.**
  You should get started now on the <a href='http://math.washington.edu/%7Egrigg/math324/su11/exams/final-home.pdf'>take home problem</a> for the final exam. This problem is due at the beginning of class on Friday, August 19.

- **Sample Final Exam.**
  You can begin to prepare for the final exam by looking at <a href='http://www.math.washington.edu/~arms/m324.10/sam.fex.frSP09.pdf'>this practice final</a>. Notice that the practice final is a 2-hour exam, so is longer than your exam will be. Also, do not neglect to study something just because it is not on the practice exam. <b>Update: </b> I have now posted <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~arms/m324.10/soln.sam.fex.pdf"> answers to sample final</a>.

  The scores for the midterm have been posted on Catalyst. The "total score" is just an estimate and assumes you get the same score on the final exam as you did on the midterm. I will return your exams on Monday. You can also look at <a href='http://math.washington.edu/~grigg/math324/su11/bd3h5.png'>this histogram</a> to see how you compared with the rest of the class.

  [Fri Jul 08]
- **Reading for the weekend.**
  Read 14.5 and 14.6 for the weekend. If you have forgotten how to take partial derivatives (by pretending that all variables but one are constants) then you should also read 14.3. Your goals should be to understand the general chain rule formula, know how to use the gradient to take directional derivatives, and understand what information the gradient vector gives you.

  [Thu Jun 30]

  These sections are a quick read. I would also recommend some of the first 15 problems in each section to give you a feel for cylindrical and spherical coordinates. There will also be a quiz on Friday.
  [Wed Jun 29]
- **Quiz 1 Results.**
  The results of your first quiz can be seen in the <a href='https://catalyst.uw.edu/gradebook/grigg/46855'>Catalyst grade book</a>.

For information on what your quiz score means, see the <a href="http://math.washington.edu/~grigg/math324/su11-syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.
  [Mon Jun 27]
- **Read 15.6 for Monday.**
  For the first half of the section, the explanations are bad, but the examples are very good. Focus on the examples. The applications half of the section is good.
  [Fri Jun 24]

  [Wed Jun 22]
- **Read 15.5 for Friday.**
  On Friday we will discuss some applications of double integrals. Pay special attention to the subsections on center of mass and probability. Skim the part on expected value, but notice how similar it is to center of mass.
  [Wed Jun 22]
- **Hit the ground running.**
  Read sections 15.1-15.4 before you come to class on Wednesday. This should all be review from Math 126. If this doesn't feel like review to you, I strongly recommend you visit my office hours this week. The first homework assignment and quiz will cover this material. You should be able to do any double integral I throw at you, and you should understand polar coordinates.
  [Sat Jun 18]
- **Welcome.**
  Welcome to the class. In the first couple of days, you should look at the <a href='http://math.washington.edu/~grigg/math324/su11-syllabus.html'>syllabus</a> and <a href="http://math.washington.edu/~grigg/math324/su11/homework/homework1.html">first homework assignment</a>.
