# General Information

**Instructor:** Nathan Grigg (<grigg@uw.edu>)

**Class web page:** <http://math.washington.edu/~grigg/math324/su11.html>. You are expected to monitor the website for announcements and homework assignments. You may also subscribe to the RSS feed linked there.

**Textbook:** *Multivariable Calculus* (Volume 2 of a custom version of *Stewart, 6th edition, Early Transcendentals*). You may be able to use other editions of the book.

# Student responsibilities

It is your responsibility to learn the skills and material that this course covers. In particular, we will assume in our class discussions that everyone has read the appropriate section in the book and attempted some of the easier homework problems before class. There may be material on the homework, quizzes, or exams that we do not fully discuss in class.

In addition to reading to book before class, you should think of some questions to ask. They could be specific, such as "What does the n in the example on page 955 refer to?" or more general, like "How do you convert from cylindrical coordinates to spherical coordinates?" Learning to ask good questions is an important learning skill.  In addition, you should always be asking yourself "What parts of this do I not understand?" and "What can I do to fill in these gaps in my knowledge/ability?" Often the quickest way to answer the first question is by doing homework problems.

# Schedule and exams

- **Week 1.** 15.1-15.5: review of double integrals
- **Week 2.** 15.6-15.8: triple integrals
- **Week 3.** 15.9: change of variables <!--short week-->
- **Week 4.** 14.5-14.6: chain rule and gradient. **Midterm exam Friday, July 15.**
- **Week 5.** 16.1-16.2: vector fields and line integrals
- **Week 6.** 16.3-16.4: Green's theorem  <!--miss mon-->
- **Week 7.** 16.5-16.6: curl and divergence
- **Week 8.** 16.7-16.8: surface integrals and Stokes' theorem <!--miss mon wed-->
- **Week 9.** 16.9: divergence theorem. **Final exam Friday, Aug 19.**

You may use one page of notes and a scientific (non-graphing) calculator on the exams. There will be a take-home component to the final exam that will be due at the beginning of the last day of class. The midterm exam is worth 28% of your total grade, and the final exam is worth 40% of your total grade.

# Quizzes

We will have quizzes every Friday except for exam days. You will have 10-15 minutes to take each quiz. Quizzes will be graded on a letter scale, with A meaning perfect, B meaning mostly correct, C meaning partially correct, D meaning mostly incorrect, and E meaning incorrect or blank. You will receive full credit for an A or B, half credit for a C, and no credit for a D or E. If you receive a C or lower, you will be able to make up the quiz during my office hours. I may decide to limit the number of times you can make up a quiz. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped. Quizzes are worth 22% of your total grade.

# Homework

Homework is due on Fridays. The assignments will be posted on the class website. A few problems are graded from each homework. Your lowest homework score is dropped. No late homeworks are accepted. Homework is worth 10% of your total grade.

Below each assignment on the website, there is a place for you to enter comments. You can use these comments to ask questions about the homework and answer other students' questions.

# Office Hours

I will hold office hours on Tuesday mornings from 9:30 to 10:30 and Wednesday afternoons from 3:30 to 4:30 in Art 336.
