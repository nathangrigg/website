## Computer Resources

#### A&S Remote Desktop.

See [this page](/~grigg/math308/remote-desktop.html) to see how you can
connect to the College of Arts and Sciences' computer lab from the
comfort of your home. This is a very good way to have access to Matlab
and Maple while you are a UW student.

#### Linear Algebra Basics

Here are some examples of how you can use different math software to do
linear algebra. Feel free to ask me if you need help beyond this.

-   Maple: [pdf](linearalgebra-maple.pdf) | [maple
    worksheet](linearalgebra.mw)
-   Mathematica: [pdf](linearalgebra-mathematica.pdf) | [mathematica
    notebook](linearalgebra.nb)
-   Matlab: [pdf](linearalgebra-matlab.pdf)

#### Matlab Screencasts (each 5 minutes or less)

-   [Using Matlab to do row
    reduction.](http://screencast.com/t/NDY5ZTNmOWY)
-   [Finding and graphing a best fit
    line.](http://screencast.com/t/MjFiY2E1)
