Don't forget that the [first homework][hw] is due Wednesday in class. Please write up your solutions neatly and staple your pages together.

If you must miss class on a day that homework is due, you can bring the assignment to my office hours on Tuesday or put it in my mailbox, which is located on the first floor of the C-wing of Padelford Hall.
