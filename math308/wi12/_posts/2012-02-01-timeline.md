We will cover section 3.1 and 3.2 today, and 3.3 on Friday and Monday. We are still a little behind from the snow days, but not enough to change any homework due dates.

Homework 4 will be due next Wednesday as originally planned. Unless I announce otherwise, the rest of the homeworks will also be due on Wednesdays. The second exam will definitely be given on Friday, February 24, as originally planned.
