The exam will cover sections 3.1 thru 3.8, except for a few topics from a few sections. A good guide should be that if I assigned homework on a topic, I might ask an exam question about that topic.

Note that we covered slightly less material this quarter than my class did in previous quarters, so there are a couple things on the practice midterm  exams that I will not ask you to do on your midterm.

Specifically, I will not ask you questions about a linear transformation without giving a formula or description (Winter 2010 problem 3) or ask you to prove that a certain function is a linear transformation (Winter 2010 problem 6). I will probably ask about orthogonal bases, but definitely not about orthonormal bases (Spring 2010 problem 2b).

All of these are things that you could do, but that I did not assign homework problems on.
