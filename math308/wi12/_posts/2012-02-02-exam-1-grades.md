title: Grades from Exam 1
---

Your first exam has been graded. Grades are posted on [Catalyst][cat].
This [histogram][hist] will show you how you compare to the class.
It is too soon to say how exam grades correspond to class grades, but
I estimate a 28 on this exam corresponds to a 2.0.

Exams will be handed back on Friday. If you would like me to take a second
look at how I graded a specific problem, please write a short explanation
of what you think I overlooked and hand it to me with your exam.
