Grades for your final exams will be posted to Catalyst as soon as I have them. Course grades will be posted there as well.

If you would like to see your graded exam, you may come to my office hours any time during Spring quarter. My office hours will be posted [here]({{ site.url }}) once Spring quarter begins.
