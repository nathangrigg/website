Grades for Exam 2 are posted [on Catalyst][cat]. If you want to see how you did in relation to the rest of the class, I have posted a [histogram of scores][hist].

Catalyst is also calculating a total class score for you. This percentage drops your lowest homework scores and assumes that your score on the final exam is the average of your two midterm scores. Each 2 points (out of 45) better your score is on the final than this average will add about 1.5 percentage points to your score.
