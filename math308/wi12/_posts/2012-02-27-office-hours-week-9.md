I will need to rearrange my office hours for this week. I am cancelling both my Tuesday and Friday office hours.

I will instead hold special office hours on Thursday, March 1, from 12:00 to 1:30.

You are welcome to ask questions by email, or set up another time (probably next week) to meet with me.
