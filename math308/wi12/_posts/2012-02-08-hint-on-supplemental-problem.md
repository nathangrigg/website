title: Hint on the supplemental problem
---

If you are struggling with the supplemental problem,
this should get you started: If you are reflecting vectors
across a plane and you want to find the plane, you want to look
at all the vectors that do not move. In other words, you want
to solve the equation <i>A</i><b>x</b>=<b>x</b>.

You still have a little more work to do, though, because this system of
equations has variables on both sides of the equal sign.
