The final exam will be given at the university scheduled time, from 2:30 to 4:20 on March 14, 2012. The rules for the final exam are the same as for the midterms, that is, one page of notes and no calculators.

There will be a [CLUE][clue] review session from 8-10 pm on Sunday, March 11 in MGH 254. You can also use the practice exams from the [exams][exams] page to help you study for the final.

I will hold my normal office hours on Friday, March 9 and Tuesday, March 13. Please do not expect responses to emails sent on the day of the exam.
