The page  [www.kaleidoscope.net/greg/math/rref](http://www.kaleidoscope.net/greg/math/rref/) has a great row reduction calculator. You might find this helpful while you are learning to row reduce.

On the first day of class, we covered sections 1.1 and 1.2. Read sections 1.1-1.3 before class on Friday.
