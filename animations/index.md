Here are some animations and graphics that I have used in teaching
Calculus or Linear Algebra. Most are made in Mathematica and many
include the Mathematica code so that you can tweak them if you want.

# Animations

-   [Sphere + Cone = Cylinder](ConeSphereCylinder.html)
-   [Parametrize with respect to Arc Length](ArcLengthAnimation.html)
-   [Oscillations: damping and resonance](oscillations/)
