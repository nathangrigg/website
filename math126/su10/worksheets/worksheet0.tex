{\bf Worksheet 0 --- Math 126 --- Summer 2010}
\end{center}
\noindent
The goal of this worksheet is to help you review concepts you learned in Math 124 and Math 125. Work in groups. You may need to use your own scratch paper.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the names of the people in the your group?
\vfill

\item If your group were to go see a movie together, which would you see?
\vfill
\item What is the derivative of $f(x)=x\sin\sqrt x$?
\vfill
\item What is the derivative of $\displaystyle g(t)=\sin\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{t^2}{7}+5}\right)$?
\vfill
\item What is $\displaystyle \int \frac{3x}{x^2-x-6}\,dx$? [Use partial fractions]
\vfill
\item What is $\displaystyle \int_1^2 \frac{1}{x(\ln x)^4}\, dx$? [Use $u$-substitution]
\vfill
\item A particle is traveling along a curve. At time $t$, its position is
\begin{align*}
x(t)&=t^3+t^2+t\\
y(t)&=t^4+t^3+t^2+1
\end{align*}
Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at time $t=1$. 

\end{enumerate}
