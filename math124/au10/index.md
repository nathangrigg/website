# Files

I am posting some solutions to problems from the sample final/worksheet
that we talked about in class. These solutions are all the solutions
that are posted online. I gathered them together in one place for you
here: [final-worksheet-solutions.pdf](final-worksheet-solutions.pdf).

There are solutions to the second half of the sample final/worksheet
here: [final-worksheet-solutions2.pdf](final-worksheet-solutions2.pdf)

# Office Hours

**Mondays and Thursdays, 1:00-2:00**

My office hours will be held in the [Math Study

Even when I am not holding office hours, the Math Study Center is a
great place to do your homework.
