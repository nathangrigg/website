I was born in Idaho, went to school at BYU in Utah, and now live in Seattle. I love to spend time with my wife and two daughters.

I also like playing around with computers. I probably spend more time figuring out ways to be more productive than the resulting increase in productivity saves. But I enjoy it, and sometimes I write about things I've done or learned on my [personal blog][blog].

I post sporadically on [Twitter][twitter]. I have a [PGP key][key] that no one ever uses.

I maintain this site using [Jekyll][jek]. The site template and style files are available in a [github repository][repo].
